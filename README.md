# Elicipy

Elicipy is an Expert elicitation Python code.

The input files are created with a companion WebApp that can be dowloaded at:

https://github.com/demichie/createWebform

Once the seed and target questions have been answered by the expert, copy the content of the DATA folder generated by the WebApp. 

Then, you can run the Python script:

> python elicipy.py

The script will create a new folder with a .pptx presentation of the results of the elicitation.

    % Description
    %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    % This function calculates the statistical accuracy (or calibration score) 
    % of expert over the set of seed items.
    %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    % Input(s)
    %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    % M: An EÎ§B matrix that contains the number of the realizations captured in 
    % every bin that is formed by the quantiles provided by every expert e. 
    % Where E is the number of the experts and B the number of the bins.
    % 
    % Note: If this function is used to compute the calibration score of a DM 
    % that was obtained from a case where only one expert had a non-zero weight 
    % and one of the quantiles is exactly equal to the realization, attention 
    % should be paid to the calculation of matrix M. Due to precision of the 
    % calculating engine, it might occur that the resulted quantile from 
    % integrating the density has a minor difference with the initial 
    % assessment that will result in a different matrix M and subsequently a 
    % different calibration score. To solve this, the user could use digits or 
    % roundn MATLAB functions to set the precision of the obtained quantiles 
    % such that it is relevant for the values of the variables under 
    % consideration.
    %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    % Output(s)
    %--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    % CS: A scalar CS with the statistical accuracy (or calibration score) of 
    % the expert over the set of seed items.
